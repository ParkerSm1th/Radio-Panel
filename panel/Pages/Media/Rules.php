     <h5 class="card-sub">Twitter</h5>
     <ul class="moved">
        <li>Twitter will generally be used for posting Now, Next, Later updates regarding who is DJing, and they will be structured as such, with the same emoticons:<br>
        <code>
          ▶️ Now: DJ [Current Slot DJ Name]<br>
          ⏩ Next: DJ [Current Slot DJ Name]<br>
          ⏭️ Later: DJ [Current Slot DJ Name]<br>
        </code></li>
      	<li>If you are unsure about who is next, you can check the booked slots from the panel, or look at the website as well.</li>
      	<li>It would be good to try to post as many hourly updates as possible so we keep up with the radio in real time. </li>
      	<li>Before you post, make sure to check with the rest of the Media team, and Media Admin so we can avoid double posting as much as possible. </li>

     </ul>

     <h5 class="card-sub">Instagram</h5>
     <ul class="moved">
       <li>Besides posting meet the staff and important radio updates, Instagram will mostly be used for its story function rather than the actual posting. Like Twitter, we will post Now, Next, Later updates to keep up with the radio and advertise as much as possible.
       <li>Once we acquire partners, we may make posts regarding our partnerships and those will likely be handled by a Media Manager, Admin, or someone from the Ownership team.
       <li>Introducing Meet the Staff on Instagram!
         <ul>
           <li>This is a new type of post we are hoping to incorporate to make our page more interactive and appealing to people that may be interested in joining the KeyFM team.</li>
           <li>You will likely be assigned a couple of staff members, ask them for a picture that they would like posted, it can be of theirself or something that is related to their DJ name or Key. If you are unsure about a photo ask a Media Manager. </li>
           <li>After you get their picture, you will ask them the below questions then post on the instagram with the picture as their profile picture.<br>
             <ul>
                <li>DJ or Media Name</li>
            		<li>Current KeyFM Rank</li>
            		<li>Favorite Genre of music</li>
            		<li>Favorite Part about the radio community</li>
            		<li>A fun fact about themself</li>
             </ul></li>
         </ul></li>

     </ul>

     <h5 class="card-sub">News Articles</h5>

       <li> Do not present fake news as it appears as if we are unprofessional and not a credible source of information for our viewers and listeners.</li>
